        <h3>1: Get on the Alabama Progressive Action Mailing List.</h3> We'll send you information about how <em>you</em> &emdash yes, you &emdash can help queer rights and other progressive causes in Alabama, one small step at a time.
        <h3>2: Check out the full 'zine!</h3> It has more info about how the legislature works, how to influence your legislator, and how to build power to protect the rights of queer and other marginalized Alabamians.
        <h3>3: Tell your friends!</h3> Together we're stronger &mdash; so send this page to anyone you know who wants to make a difference. We'd rather it not be published on social media, but linking it in DMs, or in small groups, is totally fine!
