    <p>Join us at Shenanigans Comedy Theatre to celebrate women, with an emphasis on our trans sisters and women of color. Become familiar with resources available in the area, collaborate with supportive local organizers, learn how we can be productive towards our intersectional legislative goals, and last but not least, chill out with your community.
    Bring the family - we’ll have refreshments on-site and activities for the kids!
