    <h2>This year, the Alabama House tried to take away our rights. With your help, they mostly failed — but our struggle isn't over.</h2>

    <p> 2025's legislative session has come to an end and thankfully the worst anti-trans bills did not pass the legislature. Unfortunately, they can and likely will try again in 2026. If you'd like to assist us in defending trans rights, please sign up for our email updates!</p>

    <p><em>Below is a summary of the very worst anti-trans bills the legislature concocted in 2025.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Senate Bill 79, the “What is a Woman Act”,</strong> enshrines medically-inaccurate definitions of “male” and “female” into the very first section of Alabama code. They will likely be used to deny trans folks the ability to change the gender markers on their legal documents, and as the basis for bathroom restrictions. (Indeed, Senate Bill 79 was itself a far-reaching bathroom ban before being substituted in committee.) It was signed into law on February 13th, and takes effect on October 1st.

    <p><strong>House Bill 67</strong> would have punished innocent transgender Alabamians simply for being present at schools or libraries. The bill’s main goal was to ban drag performances, but it was written such that transgender people would have also been impacted. It also would have banned transgender youth from sleepaway camps.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 244, an extension of “Don’t Say Gay”</strong> through 12th grade, would have further isolated queer and trans youth at an already vulnerable time in their lives, sanctioned bullying from their peers, and made it even more difficult for queer and trans educators to be hired in Alabama.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 246, "Don't Say Gay Jr.",</strong> would have duplicated and expanded on the misgendering requirement in HB244, requiring a permission slip for a teacher to even use a nickname to refer to a student. Furthermore, despite its authors having dubbed this the "Free to Speak Act," had this bill passed, a single sentence spoken by a teacher (addressing a student using the name the student requested) would have made the employee eligible for punitive action and could have even opened up their employer to significant legal liability.</p>


    <p><strong>House Bill 4</strong> would have added the intentionally vague term “gender-oriented conduct” to the state obscenity law. It would have banned books about queer and trans people from young adult sections in libraries, and jailed librarians for refusing to participate in censorship. It would have also made trans people’s mere presence in libraries or K-12 schools legally questionable, and opened everyone up to harassment by anyone who might take issue with their appearance.</p>
