    <h2>Lawmakers in Alabama are taking away queer and trans folks’ rights again in 2026.</h2>
    <p>With your help, we’ve significantly slowed the deluge of anti-trans and anti-queer bills every year since 2023 — and, with your help, this year will be no exception. Here’s all the legislation we’re tracking so far this year:</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 23</strong>, primarily an extension of "Don't Say Gay" through 12th grade, would further isolate queer and trans youth at an already vulnerable time in their lives, sanction bullying from their peers, and make it even more difficult for queer and trans educators to be hired in Alabama. It would also require teachers to misgender trans students, and ban pride flags in classrooms.</p>

    <p><strong>Senate Bill 3</strong> is an "abstinence only until marriage" sex education bill. It would prevent school sex education classes from teaching about consent, STI avoidance, contraception, and gender. It would take Alabama's curriculum on these issues further from best practices agreed on by leading medical associations.</p>
