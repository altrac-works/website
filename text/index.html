                <p>Last year, thanks to your efforts, HB405, the "What is a Woman" Act, did not pass the house. But now, HB111 has been introduced, apparently with the same goals — and with the same problems. And, moreover, the proposed HB130 aims to expand Alabama's "Don't Say Gay" policy.</p>

                <p>HB111, this year’s iteration of the “What is a Woman” Act from 2023, unnecessarily enshrines medically-inaccurate definitions of “male” and “female” into state law, and ends legal recognition for intersex people. It could be used to deny trans folks the ability to change their gender markers on their legal documents, and it would serve as the basis for bathroom restrictions based not on gender presentation, but on sex assigned at birth. It would force trans men into women's prisons and trans women into men's prisons &mdash; and with our understaffed jail and prison system, that could mean a death sentence just for trying to use the right bathroom in public.</p>

                <p>HB130 builds on existing law that prevents teachers from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity prior to sixth grade. If it is passed, teachers in K-12 schools wouldn’t be allowed to mention that queer or trans people even <em>exist</em> &mdash; and that includes kindergarten teachers all the way through high school. Moreover, the bill is written so vaguely that <em>all</em> mentions of "sexual orientation or gender identity" are banned &mdash; effectively banning all sex education in Alabama public K-12 schools.</p>

                <p><strong>Please <em>write or call the State House</em> and tell them that trans people belong in Alabama, and that you oppose these bills!</strong> The legislature is moving very quickly this session to get bad bills through without scrutiny or challenge by the people of Alabama. Now is our time to speak out! Show them we won't be drowned out!</p>
