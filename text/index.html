    <h2>In 2024, the Alabama House tried to take away our rights. With your help, they mostly failed &mdash; but our struggle isn't over.</h2>
    <p>2024's legislative session has come to an end and thankfully the worst anti-trans bills did not pass the legislature. Unfortunately, they can and likely will try again in 2025. If you'd like to assist us in defending trans rights, please sign up for our email updates!</p>

    <em>Below is a summary of the very worst anti-trans bills the legislature concocted in 2024.</em>
    <p>HB111, the "What is a Woman" Act, attempted to enshrine medically inaccurate definitions of "male" and "female" into the very first section of the Alabama code. It would be used to deny trans folks the ability to change their gender markers on their legal documents, and as the basis for bathroom restrictions. It would force trans men into women's prisons and trans women into men's prisons &mdash; and with our understaffed jail and prison system, that could mean a death sentence just for trying to use the right bathroom in public. It also would have definitionally erased intersex people, hinting to vague "disability accomodations", the consequences of which were not considered.</p>
    <p>HB130 attempted to extend the state's "Don't Say Gay" law through 12th grade, which would have further isolated queer youth at an already vulnerable time in their lives.</p>
