    <h2>Lawmakers in Alabama are taking away queer and trans folks’ rights again in 2025.</h2>

    <p>With your help, we’ve significantly slowed the deluge of anti-trans and anti-queer bills every year since 2023 — and, with your help, this year will be no exception. Here’s all the legislation we’re tracking so far this year:</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 244, an extension of “Don’t Say Gay”</strong> through 12th grade, would further isolate queer and trans youth at an already vulnerable time in their lives, sanction bullying from their peers, and make it even more difficult for queer and trans educators to be hired in Alabama.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 246, "Don't Say Gay Jr.",</strong> duplicates and expands on the misgendering requirement in HB244, requiring a permission slip for a teacher to even use a nickname to refer to a student. Furthermore, despite its authors dubbing this the "Free to Speak Act," a single sentence spoken by a teacher (addressing a student using the name the student requested) makes the employee eligible for punitive action and could even open up their employer to significant legal liability.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 67</strong> could punish innocent transgender Alabamians simply for being present at schools or libraries. The bill’s main goal is to ban drag performances, but it is written such that transgender people would also be impacted. It also bans transgender youth from sleepaway camps.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 4</strong> would add the intentionally vague term “gender-oriented conduct” to the state obscenity law. It would ban books about queer and trans people from young adult sections in libraries, and jail librarians for refusing to participate in censorship. It could also make trans people’s mere presence in libraries or K-12 schools legally questionable, and opens everyone up to harassment by anyone who takes issue with their appearance.</p>

    <p><strong>House Bill 107 and Senate Bill 79, the “What is a Woman Act”,</strong> would enshrine medically inaccurate definitions of “male” and “female” into the very first section of Alabama code. They would be used to deny trans folks the ability to change their gender markers on their legal documents, and as the basis for bathroom restrictions. (Indeed, Senate Bill 79 was itself a far-reaching bathroom ban before being substituted in committee.) It was signed into law on February 13th, and takes effect on October 1st.
