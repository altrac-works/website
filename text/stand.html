                <p>Come join us after the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/657841413265128">March Without Labels</a> for an in-person Advocacy Day! We’ll assemble together at the capital, gas each other up, then go talk to our own representatives in-person, in their offices.</p>
                <p>Tell them your personal story about how you or someone you love will be affected by these bills. Most of these lawmakers have never knowingly met a trans person, or someone who has trans kids, or someone who’s impacted by Don’t Say Gay. </p>

                <p>This is our time to show them that queer people and our allies exist in the districts they serve, and we’re paying attention.</p>

                <p>We’ll be holding a virtual community call to get you prepared! Learn how to navigate the state house, how to talk to your lawmakers, and what to expect that day.
